# HTTP/1.1 Compliance Analysis for Fishjelly Web Server

## Executive Summary

Fishjelly is currently an HTTP/1.0 web server with partial HTTP/1.1 support. This document analyzes the existing implementation and identifies the gaps that need to be addressed for full HTTP/1.1 compliance according to RFC 2616.

## Current Implementation Status

### Already Implemented ‚úÖ

1. **HTTP Version in Responses**: Server responds with `HTTP/1.1` in status lines
2. **Basic Methods**: GET, HEAD, and POST (partial implementation)
3. **Date Header**: RFC-compliant Date headers in responses
4. **Server Header**: Sends Server identification
5. **Content-Type Header**: Proper Content-Type headers based on file extensions
6. **Content-Length Header**: Sends Content-Length for responses
7. **Connection Header**: Basic support for "Connection: close" and "Connection: keep-alive"
8. **Keep-Alive**: Basic persistent connection support (processes multiple requests on same connection)
9. **Status Codes**: 200 OK, 404 Not Found (limited set)
10. **CGI Support**: Basic CGI/1.1 support with environment variables

### Critical Missing Features for HTTP/1.1 Compliance üö®

## Priority 1: Mandatory HTTP/1.1 Requirements

### 1. Host Header Requirement ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Current**: No validation of Host header presence
- **Required**: HTTP/1.1 requests MUST include a Host header; server MUST respond with 400 Bad Request if missing
- **Implementation**: Add Host header validation in `Http::parseHeader()`

### 2. HTTP Version Handling 
- **Current**: No validation of client HTTP version
- **Required**: Must properly handle HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 clients differently
- **Implementation**: Parse and validate HTTP version from request line

### 3. Required Methods
- **Current**: Only GET, HEAD, POST (POST is stub)
- **Required**: Must implement OPTIONS method, should implement PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT
- **Implementation Priority**:
  - OPTIONS (required for HTTP/1.1)
  - PUT, DELETE (common RESTful operations)
  - TRACE, CONNECT (lower priority)

### 4. Status Codes
- **Current**: Only 200, 404, and fallback to 500
- **Required HTTP/1.1 codes**:
  - 100 Continue
  - 206 Partial Content
  - 300-series (redirects)
  - 400 Bad Request
  - 405 Method Not Allowed
  - 411 Length Required
  - 414 Request-URI Too Long
  - 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
  - 501 Not Implemented
  - 505 HTTP Version Not Supported

## Priority 2: Important HTTP/1.1 Features

### 5. Transfer-Encoding Support
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: Support for chunked transfer encoding
- **Implementation**: Add Transfer-Encoding header parsing and chunked response capability

### 6. Content Negotiation
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Charset headers
- **Implementation**: Basic Accept header support for content type negotiation

### 7. Range Requests
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: Support for partial content requests (Range/Content-Range headers)
- **Implementation**: Parse Range header, send 206 responses with Content-Range

### 8. Conditional Requests
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match, If-Match, If-Range
- **Implementation**: At minimum If-Modified-Since for 304 Not Modified responses

### 9. Persistent Connection Management
- **Current**: Basic keep-alive support
- **Missing**:
  - Proper connection timeout handling
  - Maximum request limit per connection
  - Pipeline request handling
  - Proper Connection header parsing for HTTP/1.0 vs 1.1

### 10. Request Body Handling
- **Current**: No proper POST body parsing
- **Required**: 
  - Content-Length validation
  - Support for request bodies in POST/PUT
  - 100 Continue expectation handling

## Priority 3: Additional HTTP/1.1 Features

### 11. Cache Control
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: Cache-Control, Expires, ETag, Last-Modified headers
- **Implementation**: Basic cache headers for static content

### 12. Authentication
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: WWW-Authenticate, Authorization headers
- **Implementation**: Basic Authentication support

### 13. Content Encoding
- **Current**: None
- **Required**: Content-Encoding, Accept-Encoding support
- **Implementation**: gzip compression support

### 14. Error Response Bodies
- **Current**: Minimal error bodies
- **Required**: Proper HTML error pages for all status codes

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Compliance (Required for HTTP/1.1)
1. Add Host header validation
2. Implement HTTP version parsing and handling
3. Add OPTIONS method support
4. Implement required status codes (400, 405, 411, 505)
5. Fix Connection header handling for HTTP/1.0 vs 1.1

### Phase 2: Essential Features
1. Implement If-Modified-Since/304 Not Modified
2. Add proper POST body handling with Content-Length
3. Implement chunked transfer encoding
4. Add basic Accept header content negotiation
5. Implement PUT and DELETE methods

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Range request support (206 Partial Content)
2. Basic authentication
3. Cache control headers
4. Content encoding (gzip)
5. Additional conditional request headers

### Phase 4: Performance & Polish
1. Request pipelining
2. Connection timeout management
3. Comprehensive error pages
4. Full content negotiation
5. TRACE and CONNECT methods

## Code Changes Required

### http.h/cc
- Add HTTP version parsing and validation
- Add Host header requirement checking
- Implement new methods (OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE)
- Add new status code handlers
- Implement header parsing for new headers
- Add request body handling

### socket.h/cc
- Improve connection management for persistent connections
- Add timeout handling
- Support for pipelined requests

### New Classes Needed
- `HttpRequest`: Proper request parsing and validation
- `HttpResponse`: Response building with proper headers
- `HttpHeaders`: Header parsing and validation
- `ContentNegotiator`: Handle Accept headers
- `RangeHandler`: Handle range requests

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new HTTP/1.1 features
- Integration tests for persistent connections
- Compliance testing against HTTP/1.1 specification
- Performance testing for concurrent connections

## Estimated Development Time
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (core compliance)
- Phase 2: 3-4 days (essential features)
- Phase 3: 4-5 days (advanced features)
- Phase 4: 2-3 days (performance & polish)

Total: ~2-3 weeks for full HTTP/1.1 compliance

## Recommendation

Start with Phase 1 immediately as these are mandatory for HTTP/1.1 compliance. The server currently advertises HTTP/1.1 but doesn't meet the minimum requirements. Focus on Host header validation and proper HTTP version handling first, as these are the most critical gaps.
