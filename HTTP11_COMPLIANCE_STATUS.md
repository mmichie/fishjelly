# HTTP/1.1 Compliance Status

## Current Status: 6/12 Tests Passing

### ✅ Passing Tests

1. **HTTP/1.1 request without Host header** - Returns 400 Bad Request
2. **HTTP/1.0 request without Host header** - Returns 200 OK
3. **OPTIONS method** - Returns 200 OK with Allow header
4. **HEAD method** - Returns headers only without body
5. **Invalid HTTP version** - Returns 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
6. **Connection: close honored** - Properly closes connection when requested

### ❌ Failing Tests

1. **HTTP/1.1 with Host header** - Timing out (keep-alive issue)
2. **Unknown method (PATCH)** - Returns 405 correctly but test expects both 405 and 501
3. **HTTP/1.1 default keep-alive** - Timing out (keep-alive issue)
4. **If-Modified-Since** - Not implemented (needs 304 Not Modified)
5. **POST without Content-Length** - Returns 411 correctly but times out (keep-alive issue)
6. **Basic response headers** - Timing out (keep-alive issue)

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Features
- ✅ Host header validation for HTTP/1.1
- ✅ HTTP version parsing and validation
- ✅ OPTIONS method support
- ✅ 405 Method Not Allowed for unknown methods
- ✅ 411 Length Required for POST without Content-Length
- ✅ 505 HTTP Version Not Supported
- ✅ Connection header handling (HTTP/1.0 vs 1.1 defaults)
- ✅ Test mode for easier testing

### Known Issues
- Keep-alive connections cause timeouts in test suite
- Test suite has bug expecting both 405 AND 501 for unknown methods
- Fork-based model makes keep-alive handling complex

### Next Steps
1. Fix keep-alive connection handling properly
2. Implement If-Modified-Since and 304 Not Modified
3. Consider migrating to ASIO for better connection management
